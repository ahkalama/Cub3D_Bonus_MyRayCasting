# Cub3D_MyFirstRayCasting
 Cub3D is a first-person perspective maze game developed using the C and the Raycasting technique. Raycasting is a method used in computer graphics to render a 3D scene from a 2D map. In Cub3D, each pixel on the screen is calculated using rays cast from the player's viewpoint, allowing for the simulation of depth and perspective.
